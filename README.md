# Repository Dashboard

The Repository Dashboard is a web application that allows you to access key
information from a GitHub public repository all in one place. Simply input the
owner and repository name, click "Load," and you'll get an overview of pull
requests, issues, contributors, and branches.

## Features

- **Pull Requests**: View a list of pull requests along with their details.
- **Issues**: Browse through issues, including issue number, user, assignees, and labels.
- **Contributors**: See a list of contributors, their contributions, additions, and deletions.
- **Branches**: Visualize the repository's branches and explore the commits within each branch.
